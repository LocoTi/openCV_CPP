TrackbarCallback 	onChange = 0,
void * 	userdata = 0 
)		
#include <opencv2/highgui.hpp>
Creates a trackbar and attaches it to the specified window.
The function createTrackbar creates a trackbar (a slider or range control) with the

HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) and HSV (hue, saturation, value, also known as HSB or hue,
 saturation, brightness) are alternative representations of the RGB color model, designed in the 1970s 
 by computer graphics researchers to more closely align with the way human vision perceives 
 color-making attributes. In these models, colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice,
 around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top.
